## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Software Engineering student who loves building tools that make life easier. Whether it’s crafting a survival RPG, analyzing cheese with machine learning, or creating full-stack web apps, I’m all about clean, efficient, and user-focused solutions.

I'm currently seeking internships and entry-level roles where I can grow as a developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and keep pushing my limits. I’m always learning, always building, and always leveling up—whether it’s in code, fitness, or life in general.
